'''This code defines a Python class called `Number` with a custom `__init__` method for initialization and a custom `__add__` method to define how instances of this class should behave when the `+` operator is used with them. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `class Number:`: This line starts the definition of the `Number` class.

2. `def __init__(self, num):`: This is the constructor method of the `Number` class. It is called when you create a new instance of the class, and it initializes the object's `num` attribute with the value provided as an argument.

3. `self.num = num`: Inside the constructor, the `num` attribute of the instance is set to the value passed as the `num` argument.

4. `def __add__(self, num2):`: This is a special method in Python called a "magic method" or "dunder method." It's defined with the double underscore (`__`) before and after the method name. In this case, it's the `__add__` method, which is called when the `+` operator is used with an instance of the `Number` class.

5. `print("Let's add")`: This line simply prints "Let's add" when the `+` operator is used, just for illustration purposes. It doesn't affect the actual addition operation.

6. `return self.num + num2.num`: This line performs the addition of the `num` attribute of the current instance (`self.num`) and the `num` attribute of the other `Number` object (`num2`). The result is returned as the result of the addition operation.

Now, let's see how this class is used:

```python
n1 = Number(4)  # Create an instance of Number with num attribute set to 4
n2 = Number(6)  # Create another instance of Number with num attribute set to 6

sum = n1 + n2   # This line triggers the __add__ method of n1 with n2 as the argument
print(sum)      # This will print the result of the addition, which is 10
```

So, when you create instances `n1` and `n2` and then use the `+` operator between them, the `__add__` method is called, and it prints "Let's add" and returns the sum of their `num` attributes, which is 10. The result is stored in the `sum` variable and then printed, resulting in the output:

```
Let's add
10
