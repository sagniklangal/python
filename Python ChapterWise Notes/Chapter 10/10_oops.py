'''This code defines a Python class named `Number`, creates an instance of that class, sets two attributes `a` and `b` for the instance, calculates the sum of these attributes using a class method `sum`, and then prints the result. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. `class Number:`: This line defines a class named `Number`. In Python, classes are used to define blueprints for creating objects (instances). In this case, `Number` is the class.

2. `def sum(self):`: Inside the `Number` class, this line defines a method named `sum`. This method doesn't take any arguments other than `self`, which is a reference to the instance of the class. It's a method that calculates the sum of two attributes, `a` and `b`.

3. `return self.a + self.b`: Within the `sum` method, this line calculates the sum of the attributes `a` and `b` belonging to the instance (referenced as `self`) and returns the result.

4. `num = Number()`: This line creates an instance of the `Number` class and assigns it to the variable `num`. Now, `num` is an object of the `Number` class.

5. `num.a = 12` and `num.b = 34`: These lines set the attributes `a` and `b` of the `num` object to the values 12 and 34, respectively. These attributes are specific to the `num` instance, and they are used as inputs for the `sum` method.

6. `s = num.sum()`: This line calls the `sum` method on the `num` object, which calculates the sum of the `a` and `b` attributes. The result is assigned to the variable `s`.

7. `print(s)`: Finally, this line prints the value of `s`, which is the sum of the `a` and `b` attributes of the `num` object.

In summary, this code demonstrates the basic principles of object-oriented programming. It defines a class, creates an instance of that class, sets attributes for the instance, and uses a method to perform a calculation based on those attributes. The result of the calculation is then printed. In this specific case, it calculates and prints the sum of the numbers 12 and 34, which is 46.'''
